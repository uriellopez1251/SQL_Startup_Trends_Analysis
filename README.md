# 🚀 Startup Trends Analysis with SQL

## 📌 Project Overview
This project simulates my work as a Data Analyst at **VentureInsight**, a firm that provides research and data-driven recommendations to VC investors. I used advanced SQL to explore startup performance, funding patterns, and acquisition activity from a normalized PostgreSQL database.

By completing a real-world case study through TripleTen, I executed a series of 10 data tasks that mirror how analysts assess growth potential, risk, and investor strategy.
